#Guessing Game

This is Charles Gust's completion of the 20140804 programming assignment

It's a simple numerical guessing game you can play against the computer. You can choose your role, as either guessing the number or thinking the number.
The user interface is fairly primitive. It writes to the document which is good enough for the user to track their guesses and/or their answers.
The computer guessing algorithm is a simple binary reduction, and should get the number in O(log n) tries.

Eric was helpful when I was stuck "+" doing string concatenation, and pointed me to parseInt() as a workaround
